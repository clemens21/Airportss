The Wasp has seen action across four decades of military service with many countries around the world. It\u2019s sturdy design means that it can take off from rough ground or water without needing an airstrip or helipad. This versatility made it one of Britain\u2019s most popular helicopters during the 1970s and 80s, when there were concerns about terrorist attacks on British soil.",

The name \u201cLynx\u201d comes from its predecessor\u2019s animal namesake; it is primarily designed for battlefield surveillance missions where speed and maneuverability are desirable qualities because these allow them to evade ground fire more easily than other types of helicopter.",
